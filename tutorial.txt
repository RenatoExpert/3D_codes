How to make a 3D model using text
index: Paper>Notepad>Render
Writing on paper:
1) Draw in paper the figure you want to model. This case I choose letter A as figure.
2) Determine a number for each vertex, begining from '1'. Try to put it in the cartesian model (x,y), its easier if you choose 1 as maximum and 0 as minumum. You can use rational values between them, like 0.5566, 0.95 etc. 
3) In this case, we have a 2D figure. Then I just copy it twice, one with z as 0, and another one with z as any other number. So I have 2 groups of vertexes, forming 2 identical figures (in diferent z ranges).
4) Determine faces, it must be a group of vertexes in sequence (example 1 2 7 8). Put at the same sequence as you draw them.

Transcriving to notepad:
1) You need to write a text file, using format ASCII, and save with extension .obj. Also the syntaxis must be in the .obj language.
2) To declare vertexes, you have to write in the following manner: 'v x y z'. Example: 'v 1.666666 0.666666 0.000000'
Write the vertexes in the exact same order as you numbered them before. The render will number the vertexes in the order they were write. Remember to have 6 algarisms after '.'. Put 0 if your number isnt so long.
3) To declare faces, you need to write 'f' and them list the vertexes indexes whose compose this face. E.g. 'f 4 5 8 7'
4) Dont forget to use one line for each face and vertex and use spaces between values. Save as .obj and in ASCII encoding.

Rendering: 
1) Use a render app to show the results, like Maya, 3DMax, CAD, Blender3D. My case im using '3D viewer', avaliable on google Playstore.
